# Goaltogether

A fun football web app for me and my friends to track our games, share updates, and have a laugh. Built with Python and Django, it’s ready to grow big—think league standings, live matches, and even machine learning predictions down the road.

## What It Does (Right Now)
- Log goals from our pickup games.
- Post messages like “Match at 5 PM!”
- Show a leaderboard of top scorers.
- Football vibe—green, bold, simple.

## Future Goals
- Add league standings, team lists, and live match updates.
- Plug in machine learning to predict scorers or analyze stats.
